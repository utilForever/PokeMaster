//! \brief Move class.
//!
//! A Move is a technique that a Pokémon uses during Battles. Moves are mainly
//! used to inflict damage on the opponent. Moves usually come from a natural
//! ability that the specific Pokémon has. Some moves can be used both inside
//! and outside of battle. When outside of battle, moves are usually used for
//! transportation or for removing a certain obstacle that the player runs into
//! in the game. There are three categories of moves: Physical, Special, and
//! Status. Each type holds a different kind of effect when used.
